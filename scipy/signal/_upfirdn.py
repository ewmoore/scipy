def upfirdn(x, h, up=1, down=1, axis=-1):
    """Upsample, FIR filter, and downsample

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        Input signal array.
    h : array-like
        1-dimensional FIR (finite-impulse response) filter coefficients.
    up : int
        Upsampling rate.
    down : int
        Downsampling rate.
    axis : int
        The axis of ``x`` to operate along.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The output signal array. Dimensions will be the same as ``x`` except
        for along ``axis``, which will change size according to the ``h``,
        ``up``,  and ``down`` parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is an implementation of the block diagram shown on page 129
    of the Vaidyanathan text [1]_ (Figure 4.3-8d).

    .. [1] P. P. Vaidyanathan, Multirate Systems and Filter Banks,
       Prentice Hall, 1993.

    The direct approach of upsampling by factor of P with zero insertion,
    FIR filtering of length ``N``, and downsampling by factor of Q is
    O(N*Q) per output sample. The polyphase implementation used here is
    O(N/P).

    .. versionadded:: 0.17

    Examples
    --------
    Simple operations:

    >>> from scipy.signal import upfirdn
    >>> upfirdn([1,1,1], [1,1,1])   # FIR filter
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  2.,  1.])
    >>> upfirdn([1, 2, 3], [1], 3)  # upsampling with zeros insertion
    array([ 1.,  0.,  0.,  2.,  0.,  0.,  3.,  0.,  0.])
    >>> upfirdn([1,2,3], [1,1,1], 3)  # upsampling with sample-and-hold
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  3.,  3.,  3.])
    >>> upfirdn([1,1,1], [.5,1,.5], 2)  # linear interpolation
    array([ 0.5,  1. ,  1. ,  1. ,  1. ,  1. ,  0.5,  0. ])
    >>> upfirdn(np.arange(10), [1], 1, 3)  # decimation by 3
    array([ 0.,  3.,  6.,  9.])
    >>> upfirdn(np.arange(10), [.5,1,.5], 2, 3)  # linear interp, rate 2/3
    array([ 0. ,  1. ,  2.5,  4. ,  5.5,  7. ,  8.5,  0. ])

    Apply a single filter to multiple signals:

    >>> x = np.reshape(np.arange(8), (4,2))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5],
           [6, 7]])

    Apply along the last dimension of ``x``:

    >>> h = [1, 1]
    >>> upfirdn(x, h, 2)
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  1.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  2.,  3.,  3.],
           [ 4.,  4.,  5.,  5.],
           [ 6.,  6.,  7.,  7.]])

    Apply along the 0th dimension of ``x``:

    >>> upfirdn(x, h, 2, axis=0)
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 0.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  3.],
           [ 2.,  3.],
           [ 4.,  5.],
           [ 4.,  5.],
           [ 6.,  7.],
           [ 6.,  7.]])

    """
    ufd = UpFIRDown(h, up, down)
    return np.apply_along_axis(ufd.apply, axis, x)

def gupfirdn(x, h, up=1, down=1, axis=-1):
