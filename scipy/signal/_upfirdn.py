    """Upsample, FIR filter, and downsample

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        Input signal array.
    h : array-like
        1-dimensional FIR (finite-impulse response) filter coefficients.
    up : int
        Upsampling rate.
    down : int
        Downsampling rate.
    axis : int
        The axis of ``x`` to operate along.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The output signal array. Dimensions will be the same as ``x`` except
        for along ``axis``, which will change size according to the ``h``,
        ``up``,  and ``down`` parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is an implementation of the block diagram shown on page 129
    of the Vaidyanathan text [1]_ (Figure 4.3-8d).

    .. [1] P. P. Vaidyanathan, Multirate Systems and Filter Banks,
       Prentice Hall, 1993.

    The direct approach of upsampling by factor of P with zero insertion,
    FIR filtering of length ``N``, and downsampling by factor of Q is
    O(N*Q) per output sample. The polyphase implementation used here is
    O(N/P).
